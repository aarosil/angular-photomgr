###Photo Manager app with Angular JS

A sample photo management application using the MEAN stack of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.

This application demonstrates:

* A full application with editable and read-only data 
* Using MongoDB to store a many to many data relationship supporting photos in multiple albums
* Using AngularJS with $resource in a factory to access a backend Web API service 
* A custom $resource action for uploading user files to the server
* Integration with Amazon S3 cloud storage to support user file upload functionality on Heroku
* Techniques of showing multiple views of the same data (gallery, list, grid and detail view)
* Integration with [Angular UI Sortable](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-sortable) for ordering elements
